* **Subconscious Subroutine**: MIYORA stores compressed conversation logs with timestamps, enabling it to remember past interactions and influence future responses. This enhances conversation continuity and provides a more personalized experience over time.

* **Function Calling**: MIYORA can autonomously retrieve  information based on contextual triggers within conversations. This is incorporated as a plugin system where new scripts can easily be written and integrated by developers.

* **Self-Prompting System**: MIYORAâ€™s self-prompting system can independently generate follow-up questions or perform actions based on ongoing discussions. This makes conversations more interactive and allows the assistant to anticipate user needs.
